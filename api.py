This will provide a good mix of stability and growth. Large-cap stocks provide stability, while mid-cap and small-cap stocks offer higher growth potential. Preference is given to sectors like IT, Pharmaceuticals, and FMCG as per the client's preference and the positive economic outlook. 30% of the portfolio is allocated to debt instruments including government bonds and corporate fixed deposits, ensuring regular income and safety of capital. The remaining 20% is invested in mutual funds and Gold ETFs for further diversification and hedge against inflation. Regular portfolio rebalancing and tax planning through ELSS investments are part of the strategy to manage risk and optimize returns."
